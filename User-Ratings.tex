         M &          5 & This game is really addictive! I've been playing for a few months since I got a new phone that is capable of running it. I just had a two week break from work and spent most of it walking around, catching Pokémon and participating in raids. It's motivating me to get out and exercise when I'd usually be sitting and using my computer all day. I've even met some new friends. Make sure you join your local raid group!! It's good to plan meetups for higher tier raids so you don't have too few people. \\
\hline
         F &          5 & A fun game to do with the whole family. Exercise is a plus because you need to move around to find those Pokemon you are seeking. Wonderful memories are made with the whole family and all your friends playing Pokemon go...a plus is traveling to other countries or US cities as a family to catch those Pokemon that are not located in your area. Sometimes the game app allows us to catch those Pokemon in other countries through special raid not needing to travel. Try it out and see who can catch them all first. \\
\hline
         M &          4 & This game is a great idea that when it worked was great. But due to how the developer treats the community I can no longer recommend this to people. Update: new update with new gym system is good in some ways bad in others the tracker in game is now one that tells you what's at the nearest pokestops but it does not get rid of duplicates so meh? \\
\hline
         F &          4 & This game is overall pretty well. I've noticed that when you're on the game to long or if you're in the pokedex, the game starts lagging than exiting. Also, if somehow the game could start having better Pokemon in every cities, that would be great. I don't mind traveling to a different province to catch Pokemon that I will never catch where I live, but if those different kind of Pokemon equally show up everywhere for every city, that would be helpful a bit more. \\
\hline
         M &          3 & I have a weird issue: I had for months a couple mock location apps installed, before downloading the app. I wasn't using them, I had forgotten about them. Last week I started playing, and yesterday saw the gps apps and decided to uninstall them to avoid any trouble. Since I erased them, I started getting "gps signal not found (11)" error messages any time I'm indoors, or when I change to another app and back \\
\hline
         F &          3 & The speed limit on the pokestops is the biggest f-you so far! I have no pokestops near me, had to have my husband drive me around to get to them. Now I can't even do that so I cannot restock my bag. It's dark out by the time I get out of work and winter is coming so there is no way I'll be able to walk in the foreseeable future,unless I want to be dangerous. Apparently the people making these changes do not live in the north and have no clue what winter is or do they want me to walk in the dark and cold... \\
\hline
         M &          2 & Nov 1st, 2018 update FINALLY FIXED : the total forced 3dAR experience AND the forest background is back (no longer a plain white field)! now of course in the settings where do we turn the 3dAR experience back on if we want to? Update of October 15th 2018, VR experience forced on is cool but I can't switch it off there's no field experience no Forest behind each Pokey thing, also there are no sounds no music \\
\hline
         F &          2 &            \\
\hline
         M &          1 & The RNG is rigged. Some people get multiple shinies and perfect Pokemon and others like myself can't find any. Totally discouraged because I know that it is impossible to get so barely playing now. Super buggy and lose out on supposedly guaranteed Pokemon. Not nearly enough storage. \\
\hline
         F &          1 & Adventure sync doesn't log steps or distance that I can clearly see I've done on Google fit! Surely this defeats the object of this 'feature' It's a fantastic idea, but connect to fitbit and up the accuracy! It really doesn't work how it is currently \\

\hline
         M &          5 & Constant crashing, music and sounds turn off once another sound like a notification or music plays. I would love compatibility with my music. Maybe also some way to download maps like Google maps does. This game is a lot of fun and I don't intend on removing it anytime soon, but this game will get 5 stars when game play is seamless:) \\
\hline
         F &          5 & It's a great game! EDIT: "it's a great game" is something I said when this game first came out. It's so so much more theman a great game now. It's how i have met alot of my closest friends. It's the number 1 thing me and my wife bond over. It's a game I can play with my little brothers, older brother, cousins, && mom! It's such an important part of my life now and I thank you niantic for everything. Even though you have a hard time listening to your fans and communication is still a little hard for you guys but overall this game is amazing and has absolutely improved 10 fold! 100\% a better game now than ever before. \\
\hline
         M &          4 & It's good. Played since the launch. Like the new character clothes. Yes it's nice for you daily 30 minute walk a day to say in shape.(or in my case not to be too fat ) xD. It's quite annoying when you want to gym battle and you have raid there instead. Wish you could do both. Will get 5 stars when you can PvP battle and trade local and/or the switch games come out. Just passively grinding for switch game until then. =/ Edit, Gets a 4 out of 5 for trade and friends. 5 out 5 when you can pvp locally w/o a gym. And I hope there is more kinds of music, like on Halloween. Would love different tracks for time of day/year/weather. \\
\hline
         F &          4 & Definitely has nostalgia aspect for 1st Gen fans. Probably my only complaint would be all the micro transactions. I understand this is a business and the app costs nothing to install, but it doesn't make sense to say new clothing styles are available that you first have to unlock and THEN pay for. It's one thing to grind and unlock a reward, and other to grind for a reward only to be told you have to pay for it. \\
\hline
         M &          3 & I recently redownload this game to see if its changed. It's a lot better now then it was when it came out. What you guys do need, however, is to crack down on people with multiple accounts. Or at least give us an option to report. I live in central US and I've seen at least a few people with multiple accounts taking gyms. That's unfair to us actually playing with friends or solo. MAYBE LIMIT HOW MANY GYMS A PERSON CAN TAKE?!?! Seriously this one loser takes all 5 gyms around me IMMEDIATELY after I take ONE! \\
\hline
         F &          3 & Wonderful game, fun, and enjoy. I love it and try play everyday but with pollution air and not able play much. May someday if I am move different place. When update and lot better and love it thank to weather system find pokemon and task quests. There is some bugs events sometime but not worry. By way Please set up alerts for event as before hour of event pokemon and others so we not miss event or try be part in. Can relase aloha pokemon wild in someday? Where is Ditto I never seem them later. I hope see them soon. \\
\hline
         M &          2 & I gave this an awesome rating when it first game out. The only issue originally was the server crashes. Now it's just worse. No more Pokémon distances really killed it for me. I have no interest going and looking for Pokémon when I don't know which direction to even look. It's very frustrating. \\
\hline
         F &          2 & I'm okay with the game as a Pokemon game. But I keep running into issues and it sucks because I get really frustrated when the game freezes on me when it wants to give me an encounter for the Field Research, or when I catch something and I can't get out of the info for that Pokemon. I just want to get encounters to not be really glitchy \\
\hline
         M &          5 & I initialy played when the game first came out, as a childhood pokemon player it really excited me with the potential it had. I have just gotten back into it to check on the progress, and i would recommend old players come back for a visit. The game has grown very well. It feels like you have real objectives and goals, among other things! \\
\hline
         F &          5 & Only one thing, have some difficulty to find pokemons. There's a bright ball that appears next to my trainers and seems like a pokemon is gonna pop up in there but never does. My brother is connected to the same network, with a phone with the same settings as mine and works fine. Will give 5 stars if I can get to play it properly. Game is awesome Update:Sorted \\

Hangs till the sun don't shine! \\

         M &          5 & I had just booked Gatwick Parking online and I saw advert for this app so I downloaded it.... I thought just for fun I'd check if the price was the same in the app.... it was 10\% cheaper! So I rang the contact number and the lady confirmed it is often cheaper in the app and she said there would be no penalty for cancelling my booking them Re-book in the app.... this I did with a saving of £18.60 ..... I will always try to book via the app on future. \\

         M &          5 & Fantastic app, one question on the camera though. I'm using a V30+ LG which has dual camera. Is there an option to change the camera used for the app? Also do you guys use the Unity 3D for rendering the products ? \\

\hline
         M &          4 & It's an innovative and interesting way to preview furniture in an AR/MR way. However the scaling and also the reading of the space to place furniture can be rather finicky. \\
\hline
         F &          4 & It's amazing. The chat-tutorial is a really cute, new idea and it explained everything very quick. Camera is working perfectly fine. The only thing I am missing is the option to turn the furniture. You can turn it around to see the sides and back but I'd like to tilt them and turn them 90°. Like if I have a shelf like this | I want to be able to turn it like this - to make it "lay". Other than that, I love the app! \\
\hline
         M &          3 & The app does not re-scan the area every time before placing the object on the matrix. This is a very obnoxious problem as the app works well otherwise but there is no way for the user to fix the problem without deleting and re downloading the app again. This issue needs to be fixed for the iPad and other iOS devices as this issue renders the app unusable \\

\hline
         M &          2 & Rubbish... Wrong size when placing so what's the point? If you're going to venture into AR then it needs to work accurately and be intuative to use, else you're just risking your reputation if people start buying things they believe will fit based on this app. Buying from Ikea is fun and easy, this app however, is not. \\

         M &          5 & Insanely useful, almost weekly I need to size and place such things and as I house hunt, using this to see how a room will look for me is priceless. It's changed us from being unable to envision rooms except mentally inaccurately to live right there doing it. IKEA, you win. \\
\hline
         F &          5 &  I like it \\
\hline
         M &          4 & Trying out furniture is fantastic. I wish I could save photos or videos (without taking screenshots myself) to share with family. I'd also love the option to see a different size (eg, queen vs king beds) if it exists for a design--both when selecting the piece before placing it and after setting ... \\

September 23, 2018
Cool idea, execution isn't so great. Menu interface is slow since camera and AR is still going even when just trying to do text search. App didn't get initial scale of room and objects right which kind of defeats the point. Unclear how (if?) it's possible to rotate items. I'd be willing to enter relative dimensions of the room or take a photo sphere to help the app with dimensions. Will come back to try a later version but won't continue using this one. \\

         M &          5 & Love the convenience of the Sephora app for simple and easy ordering and selection of all my high end favorites. Sephora has faced backlash from social media for some of their brands but their products continue to deliver high quality beauty at moderate prices. The skincare and haircare brands available to purchase through Sephora are fantastic, I look forward to buying beauty through this app. I definitely like that this app remembers my card info and has an option to set my default address; it makes future purchases and reorders alot easier to place. You can be matched with other customers who have similar beauty preferences to find new products. Overall don't miss out on this one if you shop for cosmetics, it is a great app even if you shop at multiple beauty retailers! Their rewards system is awesome, lots of samples of high end products to add to your order if you save up the points for it. \\
\hline
         F &          5 & I really love the app and usually order through the app. But from past few days I have experienced like multiple log in alerts. Even though I log in it says to log in again . Could you please fix this. I tried uninstalling and reinstalling the app but no use. And my points have not been updated on my app. \\

\hline
         F &          4 & I interact regularly through this app. I make many of my purchases online and this simplifies the site. The are a few bugs within the app that frustrate me; i.e., only being able to see 20 of my gallery pictures, 20 of my reviews, two replies to posts within the community, lack of notifications when someone responds soon thre community, and products still showing in the bazaar showing as "unavailable " when I attempt to get them. I do, also, wish that survey discounts were honored with online Sephora purchases and not just with stores like Sephora inside JCPenny since that, then, requires me to go to a physical store to use it. Aside from that, there have been many improvements, customer interaction from Sephora reps is quick, and navigation is pretty simple. I use the app regularly. \\

It has old shipping addresses that I've taken out of my account yet cant seem to delete from app. Nearly shipped my order to someone who moved 5 years ago cause I cannot delete them and the app keeps making them default even though I've changed default to me 5 times.
